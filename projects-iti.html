        <h4>THE BRIEF</h4>
        <p>
          Currently a project in progress, as a front-end developer for a small charity organisation I was tasked to undergo a complete website refresh, focusing on creating a professional and user-friendly experience on their WordPress platform. With a goal to drive more donations and increase participation in hosted events, I’ve started by designing a mockup for the homepage that emphasises  intuitive navigation, clear calls-to-action and improved SEO visibility, whilst ensuring responsiveness across screen sizes.</p>

      <h2>My Approach</h2>
      <p>
        As an ongoing prooject, I have initially worked closely with the founders to understand their goals and the primary actions they want from their website users. After assessing the organisation's website, I identified three key issues impacting its effectiveness. First, their SEO performance was low, making it difficult for Google to properly index the site and target the right audience. Second, crucial information—such as details about their main projects, donation impact, and hosted events—was buried deep within the site, making it hard for users to understand the organisation’s purpose and achievements, which could hinder efforts to drive donations and build community engagement. Third, the homepage was overcrowded with information, creating a navigation challenge that could overwhelm new users.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        To address these issues, I began researching and identifying relevant keywords tied to the organisation’s mission and users’ search habits to improve their SEO and boost visibility on Google, ultimately connecting them with a wider audience. I proposed showcasing key information prominently on the homepage in clear, organised sections to highlight their mission, foster trust, and make it easier for users to understand their work. Additionally, I aim to streamline the homepage to serve as a coherent summary of the organisation’s purpose, ensuring a more user-friendly experience. Given their strong presence on platforms like WhatsApp and Instagram, I also plan to enhance the visibility of their contact and social media links and suggested embedding their Instagram feed on the homepage, allowing for real-time updates that keep users engaged and connected to the organisation’s latest activities.

      <h2>Solution</h2>
    <p>For the homepage, I introduced highlighted sections such as new product collections, recent blog posts, and an updated designer trade sign-up. To build trust and connection with users, I incorporated Trustpilot reviews and a visually engaging summary of the brand’s values, emphasizing their unique identity as a small but thriving business. To drive user subscriptions, I integrated an email sign-up form in the footer, linking directly to a third-party CRM platform, and to encourage more of the company’s principal buyers, I undertook a refresh of the Designer Trade page, highlighting membership benefits and a contact form allowing for certified clients only.</p>
      <br>
    <p>For product pages, I redesigned the layout with darker CTA buttons and dropdown menus for organized product information, adding delivery and returns details to build consumer trust and removing disruption in the customer flow. To increase customisability of the website, I integrated a new "product badges" feature into Shopify’s theme customiser to allow for highlighted product attributes.</p>
